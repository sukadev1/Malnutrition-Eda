## Introduction
Malnutrition is a global issue, especially among children, with multiple physiological measures indicating its severity. This project explores these measures:

- **Stunting**: Being too short for one’s age.
- **Wasting**: Being dangerously thin for one’s height.
- **Underweight**: Low weight-for-age in children.
- **Overweight**: Higher weight-for-age than recommended.
  
Through data analysis and visualization, this project aims to uncover trends, correlations, and regions of concern globally.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of malnutrition metrics.
- Insights into stunting, wasting, underweight, and overweight rates.
- Data visualization using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
## Data
- **Dataset**: Country-wise average malnutrition metrics.
- **Source**: Likely from UNICEF or WHO (based on the notebook's context).
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Handled missing values.
  - Analyzed key metrics like stunting and wasting.
## Results
- Visualizations highlighting global trends in malnutrition.
- Comparative analysis across countries for stunting, wasting, and underweight metrics.
